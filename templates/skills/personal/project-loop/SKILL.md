# Skill: project-loop

Announce: "Using project-loop to start a structured project improvement loop."

This skill drives a 3-phase loop for project work (features, bug fixes, refactors):
- **Phase 1 (plan):** Brainstorm → write plan → review → confirm
- **Phase 2 (execute):** loop-task iterations via devaipod — build, observe, fix
- **Phase 3 (ship):** CI green, PR, merge, cleanup

Invoke `loop-start` first if no loop is active. Set `phase_names: plan,execute,ship`.

---

## Before You Start: Fork Check

Work always happens in a local fork in `castrojo`, not on upstream directly.

```bash
git remote -v
```

Expected:
```
origin    git@github.com:castrojo/<repo>.git  (push here)
upstream  git@github.com:<org>/<repo>.git     (fetch only)
```

If the remote layout is wrong: stop and run `onboarding-a-repository` first.
If the repo is already owned by `castrojo` (no upstream): proceed directly.

---

## Phase 1: Plan

**Goal:** Understand the problem, agree on the design, write a task-by-task plan. No code yet.

### Step 1: Brainstorm

Load and follow the `brainstorming` skill. Explore:
- What problem are we solving?
- What constraints apply (API compat, CI budget, no new deps without asking)?
- What are the design options?
- What are we deliberately NOT building?

Produce a design summary. **Stop and confirm with user before proceeding.**

### Step 2: Write the plan

Load and follow the `writing-plans` skill.
Save the plan to `~/.config/opencode/plans/<repo>/<date>-<feature>.md`.

### Step 3: Review the plan

Load and follow `plan-self-review` and `architecture-review` (as subagents if both apply).
Resolve all critical/high severity issues inline in the plan before proceeding.

### Step 4: Confirm and advance

Use the question tool:
```
question: "Plan written and reviewed. Start execute phase?"
options:
  - "Yes — run loop-gate and advance to execute" → invoke loop-gate
  - "Revise the plan first" → return to Step 2
  - "Stop here — continue in a fresh session" → stop
```

**Do NOT write any code before loop-gate advances to Phase 2 (execute).**

---

## Phase 2: Execute

**Goal:** Build. Each loop-task run = one devaipod invocation + observation.

### Execution pattern

Each run via `loop-task`:
1. Run `just build` (or the project's validation command) via devaipod
2. Observe: what passed, what failed, what's unexpected
3. Append run summary to plan (loop-task Step 3)
4. Update loop state via set_loop_state MCP (loop-task Step 4)
5. Park any systemic findings under ## Systemic improvements

**Fixes happen after observation.** A run that produces a clear failure block is not wasted — it is the ralph wiggum property: the byproduct is the KNOWN ISSUES entry and journal.

### Subagent strategy

If the execute phase has 5+ independent tasks that can run in parallel:
- Dispatch parallel subagents via `dispatching-parallel-agents`
- Each subagent handles one independent component
- Collect results before the next run

If tasks are sequential (each depends on the previous): run loop-task serially.

### devaipod invocation

```bash
~/.cargo/bin/devaipod run ~/src/<REPO> --host -c 'just build'
```

The devcontainer.json in the repo controls the container image. This must match CI — loop-gate will check this at phase transition.

### Phase 2 ends when

All planned tasks are implemented AND at least one full `just build` passes inside devaipod. Invoke `loop-gate` to advance to Phase 3 (ship).

---

## Phase 3: Ship

**Goal:** CI green, PR created, merged. Clean up.

### Step 1: Verify CI matches local

The loop-gate CI parity check should have already surfaced any mismatch. If not:

```bash
# Local image
grep '"image"' .devcontainer/devcontainer.json | head -1

# CI image
grep -r "image:" .github/workflows/*.yml 2>/dev/null | head -3
```

If they differ: fix before creating a PR.

### Step 2: Create the PR

Load and follow `finishing-a-development-branch`.

The skill handles:
- Squash to one commit
- PR creation via `gh pr create --web`
- Both confirmation dialogs
- Gemini review reminder

**Do NOT auto-submit.** The user always clicks "Create Pull Request" in the browser.

### Step 3: Loop-end

After PR is created (not merged — merged is out of scope for the loop):
- Invoke `loop-end` for the state integrity checklist
- Verify skills-as-byproduct: the execute phase must have produced or improved at least one skill
- Reset loop state via set_loop_state MCP

---

## Cross-machine note

Loop state is stored in the workflow-state DB. Start Phase 1 on one machine, continue Phase 2 on another — session-start calls get_session_context automatically and surfaces the active loop in the banner. No file sync needed.

---

## After each use: improve this skill

At the end of every project-loop session, answer:
> "Did this skill miss anything? Was any step unclear, wrong, or absent?"

If yes: fix this SKILL.md inline before running loop-end. If the fix is generic, copy to powerlevel/templates/ too.

This is the evolving prompt property — each use makes the next loop better.
